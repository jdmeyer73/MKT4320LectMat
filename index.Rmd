# Introduction {-}

This web-book will serve as your copies of the lecture slides. Because the software used in this class is R and RStudio, traditional lecture slides for students are not useful, because I want to provide the code that generated the output seen on the slides. Each topic covered is a "chapter" in this web-book and will begin with a motivation section, followed by the R packages and datasets used in that topic.  The sections after that will provide an web version of the material on the lecture slides used in class.
