## Positioning Overview

### The Concept of Positioning

* Positioning is not what you do to a product
* Positioning is what you do to the mind of the prospect

### Position vs. Positioning

* ***Position*** The place a brand, product line, or organization in general occupies in consumers’ minds relative to competing offerings. 
* ***Positioning*** Developing a specific marketing mix to influence potential customers’ overall perception of a brand, product line, or organization in general.

### Difficulty of Positioning

* Positioning is easy when your product is clearly superior in an important way...
    * But few are
* Most product markets have a lot of parity, so...
    * Positioning is more important *and* more difficult
    
### Competitive Market Structure

* Difficulty of positioning depends on level of product competitiveness
    * Easy positioning...
        * Product Superiority: Clearly superior in many important ways
    * "In the middle" positioning...
        * Product Differentiation: One or more specific features superior to the competition (but otherwise similar)\
    * Difficult positioning...
        * Product Parity: No essential differences from one product to another
        
### Positioning with Product Parity

* Remember... Positioning is what you do to the mind of the prospect
* Thus... Need to create points of difference, whether:
    1. They exist or not
    2. They are meaningful or not
    
### Requirements for Effective Positioning

1. Uniqueness
2. Desirability
3. Believability

Not all three are required… But the more there are, the more likely the positioning will be effective

#### Uniqueness

* Be different in some way 
* Must get through the clutter
    * Slightly better on an important feature<br>-vs.-<br>Unique on a less important feature
* More brands = more difficult
* Find a niche that is not yet occupied

#### Desirability

* Difference should be on something relatively important to the consumer
    * Example: Is being clear in the cola market important?
* Don’t look for any gap in the market...<br>Look for gaps that turn prospects into buyers

#### Believability

* Claims of superiority must be accepted
* Believability rests on:
    * How reasonable the claim is
    * Objective support for the claim
* A common error is to strive for too many positions

### Steps in Positioning

1. Assess the positions occupied by competing products
2. Determine the dimensions underlying these positions
3. Choose a market position where efforts will have the greatest impact

### Positioning Research Methods

#### Image Profile

* Average ratings of brands/products on a number of attributes
* Easy to create, but…
* Difficult to interpret

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width="50%"}
   knitr:: include_graphics('Topic06/ImgProf.png')
```

#### Quadrant Analysis

* x-axis contains the average ratings of one brand/product on a number of attributes
* y-axis contains the average importance of each attribute
* Easily shows what attributes to emphasize, but…
* Only looks at one brand/product at a time

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width="50%"}
   knitr:: include_graphics('Topic06/QuadAn.png')
```

#### Perceptual Maps

* Shows the location of competing brands/ products in a “virtual” space
* Enable marketers to see at a glance how own brand/product relates to the competition

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width="50%"}
   knitr:: include_graphics('Topic06/PercMap.png')
```

##### Types of Perceptual Maps

* Discriminant  Analysis Maps
    * Based on identifying differences between objects with respect to several variables simultaneously
* Multidimensional Scaling Maps
    * Based only on similarities between objects 
* Factor Analysis Maps
    * Based on the dimensions underlying a set of variables
    * **EMPHASIS OF THIS CLASS**
    
## Factor Analysis

* Generic term for identifying dimensions underlying a set of variables
* Finds uncorrelated linear dimensions that capture the most variance in the data
* Main types:	
    1. exploratory factor analysis
    2. principal components analysis
    
## Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

Recomputes a set of variables in terms of linear equations (components) that capture linear relationships in the data
* First component captures as much variance as possible from all variables
* Second component captures as much variance as possible that remains
* Continue until as many components as variables
* Analyst retains/analyzes a subset of components

### PCA Process

1. Determine number of factors to retain
2. Rotate factors to aid interpretation
3. Interpret factors
4. Use results in further analysis (e.g.,	perceptual maps)

#### Step 1: Determine number of factors to retain

* How many factors?  
    * Eigenvalues > 1
        * E.g., Keep two components, accounting for about 85% of variation

    ``` {r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
    source("Topic06/pcaex.R")
    load("Topic06/greekbrands.rdata")
    gb.results <- pcaex(greekbrands, "brand",)
    kable(gb.results$table) %>%
      kable_styling("basic", full_width=FALSE)
    ```

    * Examine Scree Plot
        * Sometimes called an elbow plot
        * Look for bend or kink in the plot 
        * Number of components to retain is the number prior to that kink
        
    ```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
    gb.results$table %>% ggplot(aes(x=Component, y=Eigenvalue)) +
      geom_line() +
      geom_point() +
      scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:8, minor_breaks = NULL) +
      geom_segment(aes(x=2.5, y=0.25, xend=2.5, yend=3.25), color="orange", size=2)
    ```

#### Step 2: Rotate factors to aid interpretation

* Factor loadings are the correlation between each variable and each factor
    * Higher loadings indicate the variable is representative of the factor
* Unfortunately, unrotated loadings may not provide a meaningful pattern to understand the factors

    ``` {r echo=FALSE}
    gb.2comp <- pcaex(greekbrands, group="brand", pref="pref", comp=2)
    kable(gb.2comp$unrotated) %>%
      kable_styling("basic", full_width=FALSE)
    ```

* Rotating the factors redistributes the variance from earlier factors to later factors to make more meaningful patterns
* Factor/component loading guidelines<br>
$\rho<0.4\Longrightarrow$ no loading<br>
$0.4\le \rho<0.6\Longrightarrow$ low" loading<br>
$\rho\ge0.6\Longrightarrow$ "high" loading<br>

    ``` {r echo=FALSE}
    kable(gb.2comp$rotated) %>%
      kable_styling("basic", full_width=FALSE)
    ```

#### Step 3: Interpret factors

* (not)$lattech$, $bargain$, $value$, (not)$trendy$ describe factor 1
    * Might label factor 1 as "latest"
* $perform$, $leader$, (not)$fun$, and $serious$ describe factor 2
    * Might label factor 2 as "performance"

    ``` {r echo=FALSE}
    kable(gb.2comp$rotated) %>%
      kable_styling("basic", full_width=FALSE) %>%
      column_spec(2, background = ifelse(abs(gb.2comp$rotated[,1])>.4,
                                         "palegreen","white")) %>%
      column_spec(3, background = ifelse(abs(gb.2comp$rotated[,2])>.4,
                                         "lightskyblue","white")) 
    ```

#### Step 4: Use results in further analysis

* Results could be used in linear regerssion, logistic regression, cluster analysis, perceptual mapping, etc.

## Creating a Percptual Map using PCA

Steps:

1. Map Brands
2. Map Attributes
3. Interpret Map

### Map Brands

* Using rotated loading matrix and average brand scores for each variable, obtain a score for each brand on each component

    ```{r echo=FALSE}
    alphamean <- greekbrands %>%
      group_by(brand) %>%
      summarise_all(mean) %>%
      mutate_at(-1, ~(scale(.))) %>%
      filter(brand=="Alpha") %>%
      select(-c(1,10))
    attribute <- colnames(greekbrands[,1:8])
    meanxf1 <- round(gb.2comp$rotated[,1]*alphamean,4)
    meanxf2 <- round(gb.2comp$rotated[,2]*alphamean,4)  
    df <- data.frame(cbind(t(round(alphamean,4)),gb.2comp$rotated[,1], t(meanxf1),
                           gb.2comp$rotated[,2], t(meanxf2)))
    df <- cbind(attribute, df)
    cnames <- c("Attribute", "Alpha's Mean", "Factor 1", 
                "Mean x Factor 1", "Factor 2", "Mean x Factor 2")
    row.names(df) <- NULL
    func <- function(z) if(is.numeric(z)) sum(z) else ''
    sumrow <- as.data.frame(lapply(df, func))
    df <- rbind(df,sumrow)
    names(df) <- cnames
    kable(df) %>%
      kable_styling("basic") %>%
      column_spec(c(2,3,5), color = ifelse(df$Attribute=="","white","black"))
    ```

* Use factor scores for each brand as coordinates on the perceptual map

    ``` {r echo=FALSE}
    stdmean <- greekbrands %>%
      group_by(brand) %>%
      summarise_all(mean) %>%
      mutate_at(-1, ~(scale(.))) %>%
      select(-10)
    scr1 <- as.matrix(stdmean[,2:9])%*%matrix(gb.2comp$rotated[,1])
    scr2 <- as.matrix(stdmean[,2:9])%*%matrix(gb.2comp$rotated[,2])
    coord <- cbind(stdmean[,1], "scr1"=round(scr1,4), "scr2"=round(scr2,4))
    kable(coord)
    ```

### Map Attributes

* Factor loadings serve as the coordinates for the attributes
    * Loadings often need to be scaled to be used on the same map as the brands

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width="75%", fig.cap="Loadings NOT Scaled"}
   knitr:: include_graphics('Topic06/notscaledloadings.png')
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width="75%", fig.cap="Loadings Scaled"}
   knitr:: include_graphics('Topic06/scaledloadings.png')
```

### Interpret Map

* Length of line represents amount of variance explained for that attribute
* Lines extend in opposite direction
* Perpendicular line from brand to attribute vector shows how brand is perceived on that attribute
    * Further along the vector, the higher the association between that brand and attribute
* Distance between brands shows how similar the market perceives them to be

## Joint-Space Maps

**Perceptions vs. Preferences**

Preferences are fundamentally different than perceptions

* Customers may perceive a brand as safe, but it may not be an determinant attribute
* Preferences may not change according to the magnitude of an attribute

Joint-space maps:

* Incorporates perceptions and preferences into same map
* Interpreted in a similar manner to attribute vectors
* Preference “driven” by attributes vectors most parallel to preference vector

    ```{r echo=FALSE}
    source("Topic06/percmap.R")
    percmap(greekbrands, group="brand", pref="pref")
    ```
